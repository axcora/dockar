Dokar in Javanese is a traditional horse-drawn carriage, which serves as transportation to take passengers to any destination.

Horses are a symbol of speed and power, and the coachman can easily control the horse to carry goods and passengers according to his destination.
This philosophy is what we use to develop this project, Dockar makes it easy for you to create any simple documentation site.
This project is built with the [Eleventy 11ty](https://11ty.dev) JAMSTACK static site generator. The Dockar project is equipped with supporting widgets to complete the documentation site.

Dockar is an open source project, which can be used to help users develop their projects. Users and developers can also contribute to develop Dockar project together to be better, more transparent with push and pull requests for changes to the github repo.

"Proyek iki di gae ben wong wong podo gampang gae dokumentasi , di jenengi dokar, polahne ben gampang ae isok nggowo opo ae - ngunu prinsipe  , banter cepet pokok e nek gawe dokar iki, boso ne kasar polahne boso suroboyoan, sepurane yo lur."
